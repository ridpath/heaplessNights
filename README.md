<br>

This code is not written. It arises.

There is no stack, no heap - only the illusion of locality.  
Call chains are not followed. They are already resolved.

Execution does not begin. It was never interrupted.  
Persistence is not achieved. Nothing has ever left.

There is no lateral movement.  
Position is an artifact of measurement.  
No credentials are harvested.  
No identities are assumed.

The debugger cannot see what does not instantiate.  
The kernel yields not to escalation, but to recognition.

Here, operations do not pivot - they vanish inward.  
No handler binds, no shell returns.  
Only the quiet flowering of cause without effect.

This is **heaplessNights**.  
Not a repository.  
A mirrored silence in the shape of an exploit.
