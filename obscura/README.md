# Obscura - Autonomous Multi-Vector Adversarial Framework

![Status: Alpha](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-alpha-yellow)
![Stability: Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-experimental-orange)
![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue)
![Domain: RF/IoT/AI](https://img.shields.io/badge/domain-RF%20%7C%20IoT%20%7C%20AI-critical)

> Alpha release - **unstable**, highly experimental modules  
> Use ONLY in authorized **Faraday cages**, RF controlled labs, or CTF exercises


## What is Obscura?

Obscura is an autonomous **adversarial orchestration engine** combining traditional wireless exploitation, satellite spoofing, IoT disruption, SDR interference, and **AI driven decision making** into a single modular system.

Built to bridge classic wireless attacks, SDR interference, IoT disruption, BLE exploitation, satellite spoofing, and AI-driven adversary simulation — all under a unified orchestration layer.


Targeted for:

• Red/Purple Team cyber ranges  
• Drone & satellite attack simulation  
• Wireless/IoT security labs  
• Future cyber-physical warfare research (legal only)

## Core Capabilities

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Wi-Fi Attacks | Deauth, Rogue AP, Evil Twin, Hybrid ML bypass |
| Camera Exploits | RTSP hijack, MJPEG spoof, **deepfake operator feed** |
| BLE/Bluetooth | Disruption, HID spoof, **LLM fuzzing** modules |
| SDR/Radio | GPS spoof, ADS-B interference, RF replay tools |
| AI/LLM Stack | **Auto adversary reasoning**, strategy ranking |
| Satellite Exploits | GNSS & DVB spoofing, orbit-aware targeting |
| Attack Graphing | DOT/SVG chain mapping with intelligence scoring |
| Live Shell | Interactive operator shell w/ real-time plugin control |

## Legal & Operational Safety

You **must** have explicit written authorization to use Obscura.  
RF emissions can be **illegal**, **dangerous**, or **air traffic impacting**.

Obscura is intended for:

• RF-isolated labs  
• Authorized cyber defense research  
• CTF and academic work  
• Threat modeling exercises

Developers assume **zero liability** for misuse.
---
## Plugin-Based Attack Architecture

Plugins register into the orchestrator at runtime:

```python
orchestrator.load_plugin("advanced_attacks")
orchestrator.load_all_plugins()
```
Attack plugins located in:

- `attack_plugins/`  
- Must expose: `run(context)` or `register_attack()`
---
## Getting Started

1. Install requirements:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

2. Launch the orchestrator:

If you installed using pyproject.toml, launch via:

obscura

Or with full path (e.g. pyenv):
```bash
sudo -E /home/kali/.pyenv/versions/3.11.9/bin/obscura

sudo -E preserves your environment variables
```
3️. Test RF modules individually before chaining
(e.g., monitor mode, HackRF drivers, GNURadio support)

## Disclaimer
Obscura is intended solely for educational purposes and authorized penetration testing in controlled environments. Unauthorized use on live systems, networks, or RF frequencies without explicit permission is illegal and unethical. Always comply with local laws and regulations, including FCC guidelines for RF transmissions. The developers disclaim any liability for misuse or resulting damages.
